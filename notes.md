# From Cairo

More recently, the Obama Adminstration has taken a clearly ambivalent
position with respect to the issues of soveignty, law, and territory
at the heart of debates about dention and rendition. **

In early 2011, Egypt exploded in public protests that ultimately
forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign. In general protesters
agitated for democratic reforms: free elections, the lifting of the
three-decade-old emergency order that stifled political
activity and public expression, and the opening up of state-controlled
media. But they also protested against the state security apparatus at
the center of this repression. Indeed, the protests began quite
strategically on the annual Police Day holiday. Some two weeks after Mubarak's
resignation, as the world's attention shifted elsewhere, a curius
event happened: word spread in Cairo that security officials at the **
Prison in Nasr City were shredding documents. Concerned that they were
attempting to erase evidence of decades of brutal human rights abuses,
activists stormed the security building and managed to preserve at
least some of the remaining documents.

** Prison is significant not only because it was the site for quite local 
abuses of political prisoners, but also because it was a key destination 
for people picked up in distant locations, and rendered to Egypt. When CIA 
agents picked up ** off the streets of Milan, for example, his destination 
was this prison. As I write this, the outcome of this event is
unclear. As of yet, for example, I am unaware any documents relating
directly to Egypt's role in extraordinary rendition. Yet the very fact
of this event does show the degree to which the practices of
extradordinary rendtion depend on a localized geography of
secrecy embedded in a geography of everyday life. Whether the secret
prisons in Egypt, or the use of civilian aircraft and airports, **
